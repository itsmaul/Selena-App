# Machine Learning Directory
 This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks and raw data used for model development and training prior to integration with CC. The structure is as follows:

- data: Contains raw data in JSON and CSV formats used for training. It also simulates the JSON files that CC will use to exchange data within the program.
- model: Includes autoencoder models for testing and simulation before integration into the application.
- tfjs: Contains the finalized model in JSON format along with JavaScript logic for integrating the model into the application.
- Notebook_Integrated.ipynb: A notebook documenting the experiments, iterations, and development of models for the Selena Application.

About the dataset, we use from Kaggle:
'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bukolafatunde/personal-finance?select=personal_transactions.csv'
and primary data that is obtained from any users.

This directory supports the machine learning aspects of the project, ensuring seamless integration with the application's other components.
