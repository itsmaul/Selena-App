## System Architecture

### Current Architecture
The current architecture is optimized to minimize resource costs while maintaining essential functionalities. Key components include:

- **Frontend (MD):** Mobile application interacting with the backend APIs for user input and financial data management.
- **Backend (CC):** Deployed on **Google Cloud Run**, handling API requests and performing database operations.
- **Database:** **Cloud SQL** for structured storage of transaction and user data.
- **Temporary Storage:** **Cloud Firestore** for managing OTP verification in real time.
- **Model Storage:** **Google Cloud Storage** for uploading and storing TensorFlow.js models.

### Recommended Architecture
For a real-case scenario, the architecture can be expanded to include enhanced scalability and performance features:

- **Frontend (MD):** Mobile app remains the primary user interface.
- **Backend (CC):** Continues on **Google Cloud Run** but with additional integration for GPU-powered **Compute Engine** to process ML tasks like anomaly detection.
- **ML Processing:** High-performance **Compute Engine** instances for running ML models and delivering real-time insights.
- **Database:** **Cloud SQL** for relational data and **Google Cloud Storage** for large-scale data and model handling.
- **Temporary Data Storage:** **Cloud Firestore** for real-time data like OTPs.
- **Artifact Management:** **Artifact Registry** to manage and deploy containerized services.

- **POST /auth/otp/verify**: OTP verification.
- **GET /transactions**: Fetch user transactions.
- **POST /transactions**: Add a new transaction.
- **PUT /transactions/:id**: Update a transaction.
- **DELETE /transactions/:transactionId**: Delete a transaction.
- **DELETE /transactions/delete-all/:userId**: Delete all user's transactions.

## Dataset Machine Learning

The dataset used for the Machine Learning component is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/calistasalscpw/Selena-Finance-Tracker).

**Reasoning:**
The dataset was collected manually by gathering transaction histories ("mutasi rekening") from several individuals. This approach was necessary because publicly available datasets are predominantly from foreign sources, which do not accurately reflect the spending patterns and behaviors of users in Indonesia. By using locally sourced data, the model can provide more relevant and effective financial insights tailored to the Indonesian context.
